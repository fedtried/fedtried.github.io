## Problem Statement
The UK tech job market is broken for new entrants and career shifters:

- **"Entry-level" jobs requiring 5+ years experience** - making it impossible for juniors to get their first role
- **Generic career advice that doesn't understand tech** - CV reviewers suggesting "synergize" instead of highlighting relevant projects
- **ATS systems filtering out qualified candidates** - especially those with non-traditional backgrounds
- **Portfolio paralysis** - endless "build projects" advice without specific guidance on what actually gets hired
- **Job description confusion** - unclear requirements and unrealistic expectations that don't match reality

## Solution
**The Build Shift** addresses these problems through four core features:

- **Smart CV Analysis** - AI that understands tech careers and gives specific, actionable feedback like "highlight your TypeScript project for this role" instead of generic advice
- **AI Career Advisor** - Remembers your goals and journey, provides personalized guidance for pivots and career progression
- **Portfolio Project Ideas** - Specific project suggestions based on what employers actually want to see, not another to-do app
- **Job Description Decoder** - Real match percentage analysis and exact skills to highlight for specific job applications

## Approach
- **Rapid Prototyping** - 3-hour MVP built with Lovable to validate core concepts
- **AI-First Design** - Leveraging AI to level the playing field rather than make it worse

## Impact
- **Early Beta Success** - 50+ users in first week
- **Real Problem Solving** - Addressing actual pain points rather than creating solutions in search of problems
- **Inclusive Approach** - Designed for bootcamp grads, career switchers, and non-traditional backgrounds

## Key Learnings
- **AI Should Empower, Not Replace** - Using AI to help humans succeed rather than filter them out
= **The Power of Prototyping** - Using Lovable the Build Shift went live to users in 3 hours

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vite (built with Lovable)
- **AI Integration**: Gemini 
- **Backend**: Supabase with Edge functions

## Future Plans
- **Scale the Beta** - Expand to help 1,000+ job seekers 
- **Enhanced AI** - Deeper integration with job market data and hiring trends
- **Community Features** - Peer support, success stories, and mentorship connections
- **AI Credits** - Using the user system, integrate a credit based system associated with accounts.

## The Mission
Every senior developer started as a junior. The Build Shift exists to ensure that talented people don't give up on tech careers because of a broken hiring process. Your first tech job should be exciting, not soul-crushing before you even begin.
