## Problem Statement
Meal planning is time-consuming, and food waste is a costly issue. Many existing solutions are either too rigid or require too much manual input. Users struggle to:  
- Plan meals that fit their budget and dietary needs.  
- Minimise ingredient waste while still enjoying variety.  
- Generate accurate shopping lists without effort.  

## User Stories
- **As a busy professional**, I want a quick way to generate a meal plan so that I donâ€™t have to spend time deciding what to eat.  
- **As a cost-conscious user**, I need to optimise ingredient usage to reduce food waste and save money.  
- **As someone with dietary restrictions**, I want meal plans that automatically adjust to my preferences.  

## Solution
To address these issues, I designed and developed **Cuvio**, a meal-planning app with:  
âœ… **Smart meal generation** â€“ Balanced meal plans with controlled recipe repetition.  
âœ… **Waste reduction** â€“ Ingredients are optimised to use full package sizes where possible.  
âœ… **Shopping list automation** â€“ Instant lists generated based on planned meals.  
âœ… **Flexible scaling** â€“ Plans adapt based on household size and budget.  

### Approach  
- **User Research**: Conducted informal interviews and competitor analysis to refine feature priorities.  
- **Design & Development**: Built a Next.js frontend with Supabase for the backend, integrating Stripe for future monetisation.  
- **Agile Execution**: Iterated on key features based on testing feedback while balancing solo development constraints.  
- **Launch Strategy**: Worked on branding, SEO, and social media presence to support the upcoming launch.  

## Impact
ðŸ“Œ **Currently in pre-launch phase**, but early feedback highlights:  
- **Users appreciate the automation** â€“ less time planning, more time cooking.  
- **Scalability is a key differentiator** â€“ adjusting portions and budgets is seamless.  
- **Potential for growth** â€“ niche competitors lack the same flexibility.  

## Key Learnings  
ðŸ”¹ **Prioritisation is crucial** â€“ balancing feature scope and launch timelines is challenging when building solo.  
ðŸ”¹ **GTM is its own beast** â€“ strong product execution doesnâ€™t guarantee adoption without a clear marketing strategy.  
ðŸ”¹ **User research is ongoing** â€“ real-world usage will refine future iterations.
