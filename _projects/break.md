## Problem Statement
Busy professionals often neglect breaks due to back-to-back meetings and demanding workloads. Existing break reminder apps fall short because they:  
- Are **too rigid**, dismissing breaks when missed instead of adapting.  
- Focus on **productivity over wellbeing**, rather than preventing burnout.  
- Lack **integration with work schedules**, making them impractical in dynamic environments.  

## User Stories
- **As a professional with a packed schedule**, I want break reminders that accommodate meetings so I can stay productive without feeling guilty.  
- **As someone experiencing burnout**, I need gentle encouragement to take breaks without added stress.  
- **As a knowledge worker**, I want a hands-free solution that tracks my breaks without requiring manual input.  

## Solution
To address these challenges, I designed and developed **Break Buddy**, an iOS app that:  
âœ… **Automates break reminders** â€“ A cycle of work and break timers runs until the user ends their day.  
âœ… **Offers flexible grace periods** â€“ If a break is delayed, it reschedules rather than dismissing it.  
âœ… **Tracks break adherence** â€“ At the end of the day, users can see how many breaks they took.  
âœ… **Respects user privacy** â€“ No personal data is collected, and all stats are on-device only.  

### Approach  
- **User Research**: Identified gaps in existing break apps, focusing on knowledge workers and workplace stress.  
- **Design & Development**: Built a simple, visually calming iOS app to encourage mindfulness without distractions.  
- **Iterative Testing**: Ensured break reminders were useful without being intrusive, refining timing logic.  
- **Future Growth Potential**: Left room for enhancements such as Apple Health integration, team features, and adaptive scheduling.  

## Impact
ðŸ“Œ **Currently in MVP phase**, but early insights show:  
- **Breaks feel more achievable** â€“ users appreciate the flexible enforcement.  
- **Less guilt, more balance** â€“ the app helps busy professionals take needed pauses.  
- **A unique position in the market** â€“ most apps prioritise productivity rather than wellbeing.  

## Key Learnings  
ðŸ”¹ **Flexibility is key** â€“ rigid systems donâ€™t work for unpredictable schedules.  
ðŸ”¹ **User wellbeing > productivity** â€“ reframing breaks as self-care rather than efficiency helps adoption.  
ðŸ”¹ **Simple execution, big impact** â€“ even small nudges can shift work habits for the better.
