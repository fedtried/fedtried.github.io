      <div class="about-text">
        <p class="lead">I believe the best products emerge when everyone on the team truly understands what we're building and why. That's why I champion "super visibility" across all functionsâ€”because when engineers understand user pain points and designers grasp technical constraints, magic happens.</p>
        
        <p>My journey from electrical engineering to product management taught me that the most elegant solutions come from understanding both the technical complexity and the human experience. I think deeply about how users feel when they interact with our products, not just what they do.</p>
        
        <p>Currently, I'm fascinated by top-of-funnel engagement and using analytics to drive revenue growth. My engineering background gives me a unique lens for interpreting data and making technical trade-offs that actually matter to users.</p>

              <h4>Holistic Thinking</h4>
              <p>Every decision ripples through the entire product ecosystem. I approach challenges with the big picture in mind.</p>

              <h4>User Empathy</h4>
              <p>Understanding not just what users do, but how they feel. The emotional journey matters as much as the functional one.</p>

              <h4>Technical Depth</h4>
              <p>My engineering background means I can speak the language of developers and make informed technical decisions.</p>
